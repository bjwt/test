2. Projects
   user-order system: using ines protocol
   blivet
3. Programming language: 
    Python

    Shell sed awk
4. Data structure and Algorithms:
	 LList:
     String
	 Bitree:
     Sort
     Search
5. Design Pattern
6. Linux *
  common tools: gprof, gcov, make, gdb, gcc
* familiar with linux system api
  file:	open(), read()
  question:  why fail to create a file with other write authority by open() and set S_IWOTH
  answer: it also rely on the umask configure, which is defined in /etc/profile
* multiply thread programming
* socket programming
