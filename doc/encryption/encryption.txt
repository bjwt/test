There are two schemes of encrypting swap partition:

A: Encrypt the partition underlying the file system, which works on the block
level. This can be done by some libs/utilities such as blivet. Through this we
can protect sensitive data on the disks which were swapped from memory.

B. Encrypt the partition during running time. In this scheme, the cycle of
encryption begins when system boots and ends when system shuts down. This can
prevent some user processes to access sensitive data on swap partition which
they have no authority.

Scheme B is which we are seeking to implement.

Example of solution for B:
1. configure /etc/fstab
/dev/mapper/abc		swap	swap	defaults	0 0
2. configure /etc/crypttab
abc	/dev/sdb2	/dev/urandom	swap
3. reboots

There is no requirement to the partition, it does not even need to be set as
'swap' when it is created. So this solution has nothing to do with blivet. Any
existing partition can be used here, but once it is configured as above, any
data on it will be destroyed when system reboots.

In these two configure files, you change only two strings: "abc" and
"/dev/sdb2". 
1. "abc" can be replaced by any regular string, just making sure the consistency
between the two files. 
2. Replace the "/dev/sdb2" with the path of the partition which you want to use
as an encrypted swap.

How to verify the result?
1. check it is used as a swap
use `swapon -s`
	/dev/dm-2		partition	102396	0	-1
use ` ls -l /dev/mapper/`
	lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root       7 Apr 22 02:10 abc -> ../dm-2
2. check it is encrypted
use `dmsetup ls --target=crypt`
	abc	(253, 2)
