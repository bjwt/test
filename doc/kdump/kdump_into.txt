Kdump is a kernel crash dumping mechanism and is very reliable because the crash
dump is captured from the context of a freshly booted kernel and not from the
context of the crashed kernel. Kdump uses kexec to boot into a second kernel
whenever system crashes. This second kernel, often called the crash kernel,
boots with very little memory and captures the dump image. \\

The first kernel reserves a section of memory that the second kernel uses to
boot. Kexec enables booting the capture kernel without going through an IPL
sequence, so contents of the first kernel's memory are preserved, which is
essential when kernel crash dump. \\
